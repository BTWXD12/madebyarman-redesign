export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <FeaturedProjects />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Project Data Structure

Each project should follow this structure:

```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Project Name",
  description: "Brief description of the project and its purpose.",
  techStack: ["React", "Node.js", "PostgreSQL", "Tailwind"],
  thumbnail: "/path/to/thumbnail.jpg",
  demoLink: "https://demo-url.com",
  caseStudyLink: "/projects/project-slug",
  status: "Live", // "Live", "Featured", "Demo"
  visualType: "dashboard" // "dashboard", "portfolio", "analytics"
}
```

## Customization

### Colors
The component uses a consistent color palette:
- **Primary**: `#E09F3E` (Golden accent)
